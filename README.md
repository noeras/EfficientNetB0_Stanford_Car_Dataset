# EfficientNetB0_Stanford_Car_Dataset

My first example for creating a model with transfer learning.

This dataset has 196 classes of car types and contains 16,185 images. Images already split into 8,144 training images and 8,041 testing images in dataset.
Every class has splitted into (almost) 50-50 split. So it's really good choice of dataset for a new learner.

The goal of this dataset is make a model that have most accuracy of finding "what car is in this image?".
But our first goal here is learning about transfer learning and getting some experience in deep learning.

I unzipped the dataset myself before starting to code. If you want to have a try:
